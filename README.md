# nuget-pkg-demo
Project demoing how to push NuGet packages to GitHub package repos.

## Introduction
Long gone are the days we had to pay to host our NuGet packages. Today, things
have changed. We have many options to host our own NuGet packages for free
(including privately if we wish) including in our own GitHub repositories. On
this repo we show how to build our own packages using .NET Core's CLI,
push them to GitHub and finally, how to consume from our own projects.
